● Developed a path tracing render engine as part of a group project, which was later used in a Computer Vision course, receiving high praise from the professor and course TA.
● Implemented the mainframe of the render engine in Python, using NumPy for mathematical operations necessary for reflection calculations.
● Parsed 3D geometry data stored in the glTF format, handling JSON headers and binary bodies to locate data blocks, including vertex positions,
edge connections, and 2D UV mappings.
● Addressed key technical challenges such as specular and diffusive lighting models, collision checking, cube map unwrapping, random
hemisphere sampling, and realistic light intensity decay, resulting in a functional render engine with features comparable to professional renderers.
